> <font size=3>The eagles soar high in the sky, the fish glide gracefully in the shallow water, and all creatures compete for freedom under the frosty heavens. I feel lonely and desolate, and I ask the vast earth, who is in control of the ebb and flow of life?.  ——ZeDong Mao </font>

I'm a software engineer from China. Neither my undergraduate nor my graduate major in China was computer science—I only started studying computer science after going abroad. If you ask me why I switched to computer science, I can't really say for sure. But I do know that I enjoy coding, even though there's still a lot for me to learn.


Besides work, I like playing video games and traveling.
