I'm a software engineer from China. Neither my undergraduate nor my graduate major in China was computer science—I only started studying computer science after going abroad. If you ask me why I switched to computer science, maybe I just wanted an excuse to go here. But I know that I enjoy coding, even though there's still a lot for me to learn.


Besides work, I like playing video games and traveling.
